# python-auto-clicker
These are 2 separate files that will both help you click through training. click.py will simply click every 0.6 seconds but training-clicker.py is to be used on training that can be skipped through by clicking on a status bar. 

# For people that don't know how to use these:
I chose to write these in python because python can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store even on company computers. You'll have to download python for these to work.
You can copy and paste each of these scripts into notepad and save them ending in .py as All Files. Then you can double click it from the file explorer.
To make them stop clicking, you'll have to either close the window that they are running in, or press Ctrl + c on that window. This can be difficult with the training-clicker because it moves the mouse so often. Please plan accordingly.
